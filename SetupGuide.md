# Davinci Resolve Setup Guide

Before we start, you will need to download quite a large .zip file, containing all the files you will need for Livewires 2020. Download it by clicking one of these links:

[Windows Users](TempLinks.md)

[Mac OS Users](TempLinks.md)


### For WINDOWS 7, 8 & 10 Users
Extract (unzip) the file we provided (Right click > Extract All). This contains the Davinci Resolve installer.

Find the installer and open it by double-clicking... (DaVinci_Resolve_16.2.3_Windows.exe)

Once the installer is open, tick these options:
* PostgreSQL
* Davinci Resolve 16...
Untick any boxes not in this list (you may have to scroll-down to see all the options).

Continue following the installer instructions, clicking 'Next' where needed.
* Accept the License Agreement (agreeing to use the software appropriately)
* Then finish and exit the installer.

Now, find and open Davinci Resolve program.
###### A ‘Firewall’ window notification will pop-up - when it does, accept each window and Resolve will continue opening.
You may find it takes a little while to open but it will open and isn't frozen on 'Looking for Control Surface' - so be patient.
Once Resolve is open, it may ask you if you wish to update the software. Ignore this by pressing ‘skip’.


### For MAC OS Users



Davinci Resolve should now be setup and ready for you to edit with! Go to the next page to begin learning how to use the Sample Project while you anxiously wait for Livewires to begin! [Sample Project Guide](SampleProjectGuide.md)
