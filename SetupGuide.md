* Then finish and exit the installer.

5. Now, find and open DaVinci Resolve.

# Choosing a Film


You will need to decide which of these films you want to try to make a trailer out of. You can watch any of the following films by clicking the thumbnails below or by locating them in the folder '**video**' in each film's folder, within your livewires package (e.g. **files > spring > video > spring_blender-film536p.mp4**).

###### Each film has a difficulty rating next to it, because it becomes more difficult the longer the film is to create the trailer, especially in the time period of Livewires. And the difficulty of the editing increases with the different files available.


## ***"Hero" (4-minutes)***
###### LOW

- Audio: Full Musical Score
