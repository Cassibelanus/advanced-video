# Davinci Resolve Setup Guide

Before we start, you will need to download a rather large .zip file containing all the files you will need for Livewires 2020.

[Windows Users](\TempLinks.md) [Mac OS Users](\TempLinks.md)

### For WINDOWS 7, 8 & 10 Users
Extract (unzip) the file we provided (Right click > Extract All) This contains some of the files and media you will be using at Livewires as well as the Davinci Resolve installer.
Find and open the Davinci Resolve Installer, inside the extracted folders, by double-clicking it— (DaVinci_Resolve_16.2.3_Windows.exe)
Once the installer is open, tick these options: PostgreSQL; Davinci Resolve 16...; and untick any of them that are ticked on not on this list (you may have to scroll down to see all the options).
Continue with the installer instructions; accept the License Agreement (agreeing to use the software appropriately); finish and exit the installer.
Now, open Davinci Resolve by clicking the windows home button to see the list of software. A ‘Firewall’ window notification will pop-up, just accept each one then the software will continue to open.
Once Resolve is open, it may ask you if you wish to update the software. Ignore this by pressing ‘skip’.
