# Film Trailer Guide



## Importing a Template Project.

At this point you should have followed the [Sample Project Guide](../SampleProjectGuide.md), as you will have learnt how to import project files into DaVinci Resolve.\
We will now do the same but instead of importing the sample project we will import a template project, from one of three Blender film folders inside your Video Production package.\
Open up the folders and go to '**files**'. In there you will find three more folders, each with a different Blender short film in them with template projects for them, ready to start editing with.\
Before you import any project, you will need to decide which of these films you want to try to make a trailer out of. You can watch any of the following films by clicking the thumbnails below or by locating them in the folder '**video**' in each film's folder, within your livewires package (e.g. **files > spring > video > spring_blender-film536p.mp4**).
###### Each film has a difficulty rating next to it, because it becomes more difficult the longer the film is to create the trailer, especially in the time period of Livewires. And the difficulty of the editing increases with the different files available.


# ***Hero (4-minutes)***

Once you have chosen which of these three films you would like to edit with, open up DaVinci Resolve and import the project (In Resolve: **File > Import Project...**) from the folder of your chosen film, within the Livewires package (e.g. **files > spring > template-project_spring.drp**).

![BinNotBin](worksheetFiles/BinNotBin.svg)

The project will open and will include all the footage you will need, taken from the blender film. And in the media pool you will see several things: Bins (folders), the timeline and other footage.
Once open, if the footage in any of the bins say ‘Offline’, then simply right-click the bins, in the 'media pool', and select the option ‘Relink Clips for Selected Bin...’ then find the folder with the same name (e.g. 'video' or 'scenes') in the folder for the film that you chose. **Don't open the folder**, just click on it and select 'Open' or 'Import' (Find more info on this process in the [Sample Project Guide, steps 3-5](../SampleProjectGuide.md)

Press Ctrl+S to save your project to your computer (or find the menu item: File > Save Project ). If it prompts for a name, just type in the name you would like to give to your project (e.g. 'spring-trailer').
###### This will be saved to the DaVinci Resolve project storage database on your computer.
