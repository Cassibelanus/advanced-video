# Film Trailer Guide

To proceed with the worksheets you should have completed the [Setup Guide](../SetupGuide.md) and must wait till the start of the Livewires 2021 week but do take a look now if you wish to!

## Importing a Template Project.


At this point you should have followed through the [SetupGuide](SetupGuide.md) and explored the [Sample Project Guide](../SampleProjectGuide.md) as you will have DaVinci Resolve installed and learnt how to import project files into DaVinci Resolve.
We will now do the same but, instead of importing the sample project, we will import a template project from the Blender film(s) you chose. 
Make sure to extract the .zip folder with the film files in it.

Open up DaVinci Resolve and import a project: **File > Import Project...** from the folder of your chosen film (e.g. **template-project_caminandes-1-2-3-films.drp**). The project will open and include all the footage and sound needed from the film. And in the media pool you will see several things: Bins (folders), the timeline and other footage.

![BinNotBin](worksheetFiles/BinNotBin.svg)

Once open, if the footage in any of the bins say ‘Offline’, then simply: 
 
 1. Select any of the bins or files that are offline.
 2. Right-click one of the selected items in the 'media pool'. 
 3. Select the option ‘Relink Clips for Selected Bin...’ or '... Files...' from the drop-down list. 
 4. Then, find the folder with the same name (e.g. 'video' or 'scenes') where the footage that is missing is stored in the folder for the film that you chose. **Don't open the folder** just click on it and select 'Open' or 'Import' so that you tell DaVinci Resolve where these files are now saved on your computer. 

(Find more info on this process in the [Sample Project Guide, steps 3-5](../SampleProjectGuide.md)

Press Ctrl+S to save your project to your computer (or find the menu item: File > Save Project ). If it prompts for a name, just type in something you would like to call your project (e.g. 'caminandes trailer').
###### Info-Tip: This will be saved to the DaVinci Resolve project storage database on your computer - different to how projects in other software are normally saved.
