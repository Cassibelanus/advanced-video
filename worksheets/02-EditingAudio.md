# Editing Audio

## The Fairlight Panel (Audio)
In the 'Effects Library' window on the left (click the button at the top, if it isn't there) you will see the following list of effects or 'FX'. These can be clicked and dragged onto any clip in the timeline.
Once dragged onto a clip, a new window will pop-up with a load of controls spat at you. Other than the brief descriptions of each below, you will have to get to know these effects and their controls yourself by changing them and seeing the effect that they create.

#### Audio FX - 'Fairlight FX'
Effect | Description
--- | ---
Chorus | Adds multiple and varying sounds to audio clip.
Delay | Sound doesn't play for a certain set time.
Distortion | Adjusts the sound waves to distorted levels.
Echo | Sound gets repeated twice.
Flanger | Moves sounds in and out of phase and sync using multitude of wave types.
Limiter | Limits/ Reduces input and output.
Modulation | Similar to distortion but allows for dynamic adjustments to the sound waves.
Multiband Compressor | Reduce loudness of different bands of sounds; adjusting low, mid or high range of a sound.
Noise Reduction | Reduce background sounds that are continual and repetitive.
Pitch | Make sounds lower or higher.
Reverb | Sounds continue to play after the clip has finished. (As if bouncing off walls)

**Resolve's Audio Transitions**
Transition | Description
--- | ---
Cross Fade | Like the Cross Dissolve, it reduces volume of one clip as it brings another clip's volume up. - It has multiple preset sound reduction or amplification levels (+3 dB, -3dB).


### Dealing With the Audio Difficulties
The key to fixing the audio issues is to make sure that everything moves smoothly into the next by adding transitions, changing audio levels and that the layers of audio do not clash.
Like you can with titles and animations, you can keyframe audio levels and settings in the 'Inspector' and dynamically change when the audio rises and falls in volume, pitch, or other.
To do this,
1. Select the clip you want to adjust in the timeline.
2. Align the player in the timeline over the clip to where you want to add a keyframe.
3. With the clip selected, find the setting you want to adjust in the 'Inspector' and click the little diamond shape on the right of the setting. You have added a keyframe!
###### If you added a keyframe to 'Clip Volume', the keyframe will appear on your clip in the timeline.
4. Now, just move your player (line) in the timeline and adjust the setting for it. This will create a keyframe which will add a movement from the first keyframe you made to the next.
5. You can now use this to drop the volume in and out where needed to make way for other audio. This is called 'Audio Mastering'.


## Challenge

Try and make the audio sound like it is being played outside through massive speakers in a field; or in a huge concert hall.
###### Difficulty Level: Medium
